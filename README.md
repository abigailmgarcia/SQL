# Welcome to Abigail's SQL Portfolio! üéâ

Hello there! üëã Welcome to my SQL code repository. I'm Abigail, and I'm thrilled to share my journey with SQL through this portfolio. Whether you're a fellow SQL enthusiast, a recruiter, or just someone looking to explore my work, you're in the right place!

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects I've worked on, ranging from basic queries to more complex database management tasks. Each example here showcases my skills in writing efficient queries, optimizing performance, and handling real-world data challenges.

## What‚Äôs Inside? üßê

- **SQL Queries**: From simple SELECT statements to complex JOINs, subqueries, and aggregation, you'll find various types of SQL code demonstrating my ability to query databases effectively.
- **Database Design**: Check out my projects involving database normalization, schema creation, and table relationships. I take great care in designing databases that are both functional and scalable.
- **Data Manipulation**: See how I handle INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations, and work with stored procedures, triggers, and functions to keep things running smoothly.
- **Data Analysis**: Dive into projects where I‚Äôve analyzed large datasets, created reports, and generated insights using SQL.

## Skills & Techniques üìö

- **Query Optimization**: Writing queries that run efficiently, even on large datasets, to improve performance.
- **Complex Joins & Subqueries**: Mastering INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, and CROSS JOINs, as well as writing nested subqueries for intricate data retrieval.
- **Aggregation**: Summarizing data with GROUP BY, HAVING, and aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.
- **Database Design & Normalization**: Designing normalized databases with clear relationships and using the best practices for data integrity.
- **SQL Functions & Stored Procedures**: Writing reusable and modular SQL code with functions, triggers, and stored procedures.
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**: Using SQL to clean and preprocess data, making it ready for analysis or reporting.

## Projects Overview üåü

Each project folder in this portfolio contains well-documented code examples and brief explanations about the goals and challenges I tackled. Some of the key projects include:

- **E-commerce Database**: Designed a database schema for a fictional online store, including tables for products, orders, customers, and inventory.
- **Employee Management System**: Created an employee tracking system with functionalities like time tracking, salary calculations, and departmental reporting.
- **Sales Data Analysis**: Analyzed historical sales data to identify trends, calculate KPIs, and generate insightful business reports.
- **Customer Retention Analysis**: Leveraged SQL to analyze customer behavior, retention rates, and provided actionable insights for business strategies.

## Let‚Äôs Connect! üì¨

I‚Äôm always excited to connect with fellow SQL aficionados or anyone interested in data. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat about SQL (or anything else, really!), don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out. I'm always open to feedback and collaboration opportunities.

Feel free to explore my code, experiment with it, and see how I tackle data challenges using SQL. Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something that sparks your interest!

Happy querying! ‚ú®
